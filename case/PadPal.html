				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Project Kilimanjaro, a non-profit organization, is helping girls and women in Pune, India with menstrual health management. Together with PK, our team designed a menstrual care bag with an instruction manual. The bag can be easily hand-sewed and used to carry menstrual products safely and sanitarily.

				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are multiple root causes to our problem. We chose to go down the path of creating a menstrual bag, because Project Kilimanjaro already had some other projects tackling the other causes (such as biodegradable pad and education curriculum). We wanted to maximize the help that we did, so we chose a path that was different from, but could also supplement the existing projects.</p>

			<div>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On our NGO side they had one contacter who was in charge of communicating with us. This channel with multiple layers led to miscommunication at some points. It was over half of the quarter, and we suddenly had to change our direction from designing an actual menstrual bag product, to providing a guide for users to hand-make it by themselves. As a result, the design of the bag also had to change from partially factory-producible, to the simplest for hand manufacturing. Although this shift was sudden, we managed to cope with it and ended up with an instruction guide that satisfied the needs of our NGO.</p>
				<p>Will phrase this better:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had a conflict among our team due to different opinions on the track to take. One member insisted on a direction that most teammates disagreed with but refused to listen to others, so argument burst out. The remote environment worsened the situation. I tried to ease the tension by explaining our common goal beyond the disagreement, and it temporarily worked. But sadly at last that member still impulsively left us. We healed this loss and picked up the work again. We knew we couldn’t be stopped by internal conflict, because bigger duty was waiting for us.</p>
