				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Project Kilimanjaro, a non-profit organization, is helping girls and women in Pune, India with menstrual health management. Together with PK, our team designed a menstrual care bag with an instruction manual. The bag can be easily hand-sewed and used to carry menstrual products safely and sanitarily.

				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Menstrual health management is challenging for girls in Pune, India. Causes to this difficulty is complex: expensive menstrual products, lack of awareness, cultural and relogious factors. Secondary disasters include menstrual illness, school dropout, internalized oppression.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Project Kilimanjaro has a few parallel projects, each tackling one aspect of the problem. Typically, one biodegradable pad team is developing sustainable pad product, while an educational team offers a series of curriculums on MHM.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wanted to maximize our help, so we chose a path that was different from, but could also supplement these existing projects. We decided to design a menstrual bag. In the korean film <span class="link"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_(2013_film)" target="_blank" class="zoomin" style="font-size:100%">Hope</a></span>, the father put a handful of candies into Sowon's pocket, covering the noise of her stoma bag, so Sowon is willing to go to school. Our menstrual bag will also give girls in Pune courage, backing them to go back to school or normal daily life during the lady days.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to covid-19, we weren't able to travel to India to meet our served community in person. So we relied on interviewing our NGO, secondary research, and downloading India social apps to get a sense of the environment.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We summarized 5 key criterias that should orient our design: sanatation, sustainability, easy instruction, comfort, <span style="text-decoration:line-through">discreetness</span> (abandoned later).</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We spent a week brainstorming ideas based on these criterias. Then building on a sharing session, we splited into sub-teams to develop 3 bag concepts for comparison. The 3 concepts laid from "the easiest to make" to "the most functional" on the spectrum.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decision was settled based on feedback from PK. "Easy to make" was an important quality, since a home-makable design would reduce cost for both the users and the non-profit organization. We prototyped out concept 1 to solidify its making steps, test its function and comfort.</p>

					<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our easy-to-make bag should have its easy-to-read guide. We decided to put the manufacture steps into graphics and minimize text explanation. Picture is an international language. When illustrating the graphics, I tried to find a balance between realistic and iconic, so the steps were understandable while remained clean.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, we didn't expected creating an instruction guide when we started off. This objective was picked up on the halfway.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neel, our contact man, directly communicated with us on behalf of PK and conveyed important decisions. Despite being efficient most of the time, this channel with multiple layers led to miscommunication at a point.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was over half of the quarter, and we suddenly had to change our direction from designing an actual menstrual bag product, to providing a guide for users to hand-make it by themselves. As a result, the design of the bag also had to change from partially factory-producible, to the simplest for hand manufacturing.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this shift was sudden, we managed to cope with it and ended up with an instruction guide that satisfied the needs of our NGO.</p>

		<div class="section">
			<div class="box_section">
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our design received appreciation from PK. Our instruction guide existed in line with PK's educational curriculum, and was simple enough to be ready for adopting into their materials. In the future, PK could use our PadPal to introduce their biodegradable pad into the curriculums.</p>
